In this project, the hub includes five games
with a wide range of frontend work and no
backend support.

• The five games created are
• Tic-tac-toe
• Burnout Revenge
• Roll the Dice
• Hungary Snake
• Color the Squirtle

Each game uses core JavaScript concepts including JS libraries like jQuery and Ajax

• Different cdn links are used for different libraries as the cdn links are faster than the core library files to be downloaded. Using the cdn links browser downloads the file only once and hence, we can ensure the faster working of the site with the same (hence an internet connection is required to analyze the project)

● MainPage of Gamerz Hub
    o the main page of the hub is designed
    keeping in mind the original websites
    over the Internet. The background is set
    using video tag to give it a unique feel.
    Whole page is divided into 2 columns
    with one containing the game divs and
    the other containing the ajax which can
    call the API on button click. Also, a
    login form is attached which can be
    displayed using the login button on the
    top navbar. For now the navigation bar
    includes demo anchor tags which can
    be put to use in future

● Description of Games – Color the Squirtle
    o the introduction page just contains a
    start button which on clicking will lead
    us to the main game’s page.
    
    o The main game includes color
    palette(with audio added for every
    color) for every body part of the
    Squirtle. Choose the color of your
    choice and finalize your Squirtle with
    clicking the ‘Done’ button.
    
    o The body of the Squirtle is made
    entirely using CSS
    

Burnout Revenge
    o This game is like a normal racing game
    with only Desktop experience.
    
    o The first page is just the introductory
    page with a button which on clicking
    will take us to the main game’s page
    
    o The UI of the game is given the look of
    a winter night with snowfall effect
    using pure CSS
    
    o Even the cars and its tires in the game
    are made entirely of CSS.
    
    o Game is designed using jQuery and cdn
    links are used for faster working.
    
    o After a certain value for the score, the
    speed of the car increases for raising the
    bar of game a notch higher
    
    
● Tic Tac Toe
    o It is the old school “Zero-Cross” game
    with a little change in the UI
    
    o The game is applicable for both single
    and double players
    
    o In both single and double players
    section, names have been asked keeping
    in mind the future backend support
    which can be provided to it
    
    
● Roll the Dice
    o A simple betting game where random
    dice images appear on the screen and
    the player with the higher number dice
    wins
    
    o Timing functions have been used along
    with Math.random function for
    declaring the winner
    
    
● Hungary Snake
    o The game includes a main introduction
    page which only contains a start button
    
    o The game works like the old school
    snakes game i.e., if the snake eats the
    food, we get one point and if it collides
    with itself, game over. Your score will
    be shown using an alert box with the
    block position as well
    
    o Even audio tags are added for adding
    more fun to the game
    
    o This game can also be played in mobile
    since mobile controllers are given for
    the movement of the snake
    
    o In the Desktop version, use the arrow
    keys for moving the snake
